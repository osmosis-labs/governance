# Osmosis Governance

Osmosis has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing 
[text proposals](./text), 
changing [consensus parameters](./params-change), 
 spending [funds from the community pool](./community-pool-spend),
 and for updating [Osmosis pool incentives](./osmo-pool-incentives).

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals
and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain. 
It also provides a place for collaborating on draft proposals in plain text on Github.

If you'd like to draft a proposal, start [here](./best_practices.md).
See the contents below for more background on the governance system,
the different types of proposals, and how to submit one.
