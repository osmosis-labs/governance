# Osmosis Governance

Osmosis has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing 
[text proposals](./text), 
changing [consensus parameters](./params-change), 
 spending [funds from the community pool](./community-pool-spend),
 and for updating [Osmosis pool incentives](./osmo-pool-incentives).

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals
and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain. 
It also provides a place for collaborating on draft proposals in plain text on Github.

If you'd like to draft a proposal, start [here](./best_practices.md).
See the contents below for more background on the governance system,
the different types of proposals, and how to submit one.

## Community

Osmosis governance is driven by the Osmosis community, which has large overlap with the Cosmos community.
Much of the documentation this repo is based on
 was funded by the community fund itself in 
[Cosmos Hub Proposal 23](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/23).
Governance discussions happen in a number of places moderated by diverse
community members, including:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/MtHXKnrHDq)
- [Telegram](https://t.me/osmosis_chat)
- anywhere else you might interact with members of the Osmosis community!
